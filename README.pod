=head1 NAME

Module::Metadata - Gather package and POD information from perl module files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Module::Metadata;

  # information about a .pm file
  my $info = Module::Metadata->new_from_file( $file );
  my $version = $info->version;

  # CPAN META 'provides' field for .pm files in a directory
  my $provides = Module::Metadata->provides(
    dir => 'lib', version => 2
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a standard way to gather metadata about a .pm file through
(mostly) static analysis and (some) code execution.  When determining the
version of a module, the C<$VERSION> assignment is C<eval>ed, as is traditional
in the CPAN toolchain.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Class methods

=over 4

=item C<< new_from_file($filename, collect_pod => 1) >>

Constructs a C<Module::Metadata> object given the path to a file.  Returns
undef if the filename does not exist.

C<collect_pod> is a optional boolean argument that determines whether POD
data is collected and stored for reference.  POD data is not collected by
default.  POD headings are always collected.

If the file begins by an UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE byte-order mark, then
it is skipped before processing, and the content of the file is also decoded
appropriately starting from perl 5.8.

=item C<< new_from_handle($handle, $filename, collect_pod => 1) >>

This works just like C<new_from_file>, except that a handle can be provided
as the first argument.

Note that there is no validation to confirm that the handle is a handle or
something that can act like one.  Passing something that isn't a handle will
cause a exception when trying to read from it.  The C<filename> argument is
mandatory or undef will be returned.

You are responsible for setting the decoding layers on C<$handle> if
required.

=item C<< new_from_module($module, collect_pod => 1, inc => \@dirs) >>

Constructs a C<Module::Metadata> object given a module or package name.
Returns undef if the module cannot be found.

In addition to accepting the C<collect_pod> argument as described above,
this method accepts a C<inc> argument which is a reference to an array of
directories to search for the module.  If none are given, the default is
@INC.

If the file that contains the module begins by an UTF-8, UTF-16BE or
UTF-16LE byte-order mark, then it is skipped before processing, and the
content of the file is also decoded appropriately starting from perl 5.8.

=item C<< find_module_by_name($module, \@dirs) >>

Returns the path to a module given the module or package name. A list
of directories can be passed in as an optional parameter, otherwise
@INC is searched.

Can be called as either an object or a class method.

=item C<< find_module_dir_by_name($module, \@dirs) >>

Returns the entry in C<@dirs> (or C<@INC> by default) that contains
the module C<$module>. A list of directories can be passed in as an
optional parameter, otherwise @INC is searched.

Can be called as either an object or a class method.

=item C<< provides( %options ) >>

This is a convenience wrapper around C<package_versions_from_directory>
to generate a CPAN META C<provides> data structure.  It takes key/value
pairs.  Valid option keys include:

=over

=item version B<(required)>

Specifies which version of the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> should be used as
the format of the C<provides> output.  Currently only '1.4' and '2'
are supported (and their format is identical).  This may change in
the future as the definition of C<provides> changes.

The C<version> option is required.  If it is omitted or if
an unsupported version is given, then C<provides> will throw an error.

=item dir

Directory to search recursively for F<.pm> files.  May not be specified with
C<files>.

=item files

Array reference of files to examine.  May not be specified with C<dir>.

=item prefix

String to prepend to the C<file> field of the resulting output. This defaults
to F<lib>, which is the common case for most CPAN distributions with their
F<.pm> files in F<lib>.  This option ensures the META information has the
correct relative path even when the C<dir> or C<files> arguments are
absolute or have relative paths from a location other than the distribution
root.

=back

For example, given C<dir> of 'lib' and C<prefix> of 'lib', the return value
is a hashref of the form:

  {
    'Package::Name' => {
      version => '0.123',
      file => 'lib/Package/Name.pm'
    },
    'OtherPackage::Name' => ...
  }

=item C<< package_versions_from_directory($dir, \@files?) >>

Scans C<$dir> for .pm files (unless C<@files> is given, in which case looks
for those files in C<$dir> - and reads each file for packages and versions,
returning a hashref of the form:

  {
    'Package::Name' => {
      version => '0.123',
      file => 'Package/Name.pm'
    },
    'OtherPackage::Name' => ...
  }

The C<DB> and C<main> packages are always omitted, as are any "private"
packages that have leading underscores in the namespace (e.g.
C<Foo::_private>)

Note that the file path is relative to C<$dir> if that is specified.
This B<must not> be used directly for CPAN META C<provides>.  See
the C<provides> method instead.

=item C<< log_info (internal) >>

Used internally to perform logging; imported from Log::Contextual if
Log::Contextual has already been loaded, otherwise simply calls warn.

=back

=head2 Object methods

=over 4

=item C<< name() >>

Returns the name of the package represented by this module. If there
is more than one package, it makes a best guess based on the
filename. If it's a script (i.e. not a *.pm) the package name is
'main'.

=item C<< version($package) >>

Returns the version as defined by the $VERSION variable for the
package as returned by the C<name> method if no arguments are
given. If given the name of a package it will attempt to return the
version of that package if it is specified in the file.

=item C<< filename() >>

Returns the absolute path to the file.

=item C<< packages_inside() >>

Returns a list of packages. Note: this is a raw list of packages
discovered (or assumed, in the case of C<main>).  It is not
filtered for C<DB>, C<main> or private packages the way the
C<provides> method does.  Invalid package names are not returned,
for example "Foo:Bar".  Strange but valid package names are
returned, for example "Foo::Bar::", and are left up to the caller
on how to handle.

=item C<< pod_inside() >>

Returns a list of POD sections.

=item C<< contains_pod() >>

Returns true if there is any POD in the file.

=item C<< pod($section) >>

Returns the POD data in the given section.

=item C<< is_indexable($package) >> or C<< is_indexable() >>

Returns a boolean indicating whether the package (if provided) or any package
(otherwise) is eligible for indexing by PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server.
Note This only checks for valid C<package> declarations, and does not take any
ownership information into account.
